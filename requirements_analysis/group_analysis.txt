Title request: Medical App

Non-Functional Requirement 
Role: User 
Requirement ID: NF-01 
Requirement Title: Accessibility
Requirement Description: Accessibility is commonly understood as the degree to which the application is available to users, usually taking into account disability measures. Accessibility, or software’s ability to be “use[d] by people with a wide range of characteristics”, is found explicitly in standards but often understood as an implicit aspect of usability.
Citation: Page 8, Section 3.2; Page 9, Section 3.4 

Non-Functional Requirement 
Role: User 
Requirement ID: NF-02 
Requirement Title: Certifiability
Requirement Description: Certifiability is the necessity of CE-certification as a medical device to be used legally, based on European Union directive defining medical devices including software that assists patients in monitoring or preventing diseases and medications. It is the degree to which software’s behavior is approved by authorities.
Citation: Page 7, Section 3.1; Page 10, Section 3.4 

Non-Functional Requirement 
Role: User 
Requirement ID: NF-03 
Requirement Title: Portability
Requirement Description: Portability refers to the number of operating systems and devices the application supports. It is defined as “the ability of software to be transferred from one environment to another”, sometimes referred to as adaptability, installability or compatibility.
Citation: Page 8, Section 3.2; Page 9, Section 3.4 

Non-Functional Requirement 
Role: User 
Requirement ID: NF-04 
Requirement Title: Privacy
Requirement Description: Privacy revolves around privacy regulations and how an application that deals with personal or medical information should incorporate those.
