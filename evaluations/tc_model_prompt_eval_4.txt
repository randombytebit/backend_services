Requirement Description: The second requirement revolves around privacy regulations and how an application that deals with personal or medical information should incorporate those.

Apart from getting approval, other conditions that have to be met include the aspect that the patients’ privacy is not disproportionately harmed, and that the process favors a ‘general cause’.

Requirement Description: These concepts are related to the requirement of trust, which entails the users’ perceptions of these characteristics.

Requirement Title: Usability
Requirement Description: The last non-functional requirement mentioned by the stakeholders is the usability of the application, which is its ease of use and learnability.

While the sub concepts belonging to the concept of usability greatly differ between theories, it is principally understood as the effort needed for use, and on the individual assessment of such use. Sub concepts may include ease-of-use, learnability, aesthetical attractiveness, and, in some cases, accessibility.
