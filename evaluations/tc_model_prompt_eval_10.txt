## Non-Functional Requirements
The text explicitly identifies and explores nine non-functional requirements for medical mobile applications, derived from a grounded theory approach, document study, stakeholder interviews, and vignette evaluations. These are assigned sequential IDs (NF-01, etc.) for organization. Role is assumed as "User" based on the consumer-focused context. Descriptions are based on the paper's definitions and discussions.
