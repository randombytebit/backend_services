Hong Kong Metropolitan University  Title:   Real or Synthetic? Tools for AI-Generated Content Creation and Identification  Project  Supervisor:  Dr. Kayley Xiaoxue Ma  (email:   kxma@hkmu.edu.hk , Tel: 3120 2717)  Description:   The rise of generative AI has created both opportunities and challenges in data authenticity. While synthetic data can augment limited datasets  for machine learning, it also raises concerns about misinformation and data pollution. This project explores this duality by letting students  investigate either: (1)   AI-assisted data augmentation   to enhance real datasets, or (2)   synthetic data detection   to identify AI-generated content.  Both approaches address critical needs in modern AI development - improving model training while maintaining data integrity.  Students will choose one of two tracks:  Data Augmentation Track : Generate high-quality synthetic data (text or images) to improve model training. Techniques may include GANs for  image generation or LLM-based text paraphrasing, with evaluation of how augmented data affects model performance.  Detection   Track : Develop classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic data. For text, this could involve analyzing linguistic artifacts; for images,  examining spectral signatures or GAN fingerprints.  Requirements   and Suggestions:  NLP techniques (for text) and computer vision fundamentals (for image) ✔  No GPU needed - all work will use optimized models (e.g., DistilBERT, TinyGAN) ✔  Curious about either creative data generation or forensic analysis of AI outputs ✔  ✔   Team collaboration & regular meetings

Title:   Neural Signal Recognition   Based on   Spiking Neural Networks  Project  Supervisor:  Dr Hongli Huang  (Email:   hhuang@hkmu.edu.hk   , Tel: 3120 2616)  Description:   Electromyography (EMG) records the electrical activity of muscles during contraction and has become a cornerstone technique for prosthetic  control, rehabilitation, and human–machine interfaces. Traditional EMG classification methods—relying on extensive signal preprocessing and  deep learning models—often suffer from high latency and energy consumption, limiting their use in real‑time, wearable applications. Spiking  Neural Networks (SNNs), which emulate the event‑driven, sparse, and low‑power nature of biological neurons, offer a promising alternative  for processing temporal EMG signals directly as spike trains. By bridging EMG signal acquisition with SNN‑based inference, this project aims to  develop an end‑to‑end framework that improves real‑time performance and energy efficiency in neural signal recognition.  Objectives:  •   Develop an EMG-to-spike encoding scheme  •   Design and train an SNN model for EMG classification  •   Evaluate performance against conventional models  Hong Kong Metropolitan University

Hong Kong Metropolitan University  Title:   AI-Powered HK Mobility  Project  Supervisor:  Dr. Yalin Liu  (email:   ylliu@hkmu.edu.hk   , Tel: 3120 2622)  Description:   Hong Kong residents and visitors have diverse mobility needs, such as commuting to work via public transport, driving or walking for daily activities, and  hiking for leisure or travel. The city's complex geography, dense urban environment, and ever-changing weather conditions make selecting the most  suitable mobility option a challenging task. While several mobile apps provide mobility-related information, they are often fragmented in scope. For  example, Google Maps offers transportation and walking directions, HKeMobility provides real-time transit updates, and GovHK websites list hiking routes.  However, no single app comprehensively addresses all mobility needs, forcing users to switch between multiple platforms to gather the information they  require.  This project needs to develop an “AI-powered personalized mobility app” that integrates diverse mobility options in Hong Kong, incorporates real-time  environmental factors, and delivers tailored recommendations to enhance user experience and decision-making. Students need to determine the target  users and application scenarios. The emerging AI agents can be used to design the system and provide personalized suggestions based on user preferences,  historical behavior, and current conditions.  Some required capabilities to complete this project.     Mobile App Development Capabilities : Using technologies for frontend, backend, and database development to create a seamless user experience.     Data(APIs) Process and Integration : Incorporating Transportation APIs and Weather APIs to provide real-time data for route planning and mobility options.     Integration with AI agents : Utilizing AI agents to optimize route recommendations, predict crowd density, and suggest mobility options tailored to individual users.

Hong Kong Metropolitan University  Title:   Exploring the Divide-and-conquer Strategy for Machine Learning-based Image Processing  Project  Supervisor:  Dr. Jimmy S. Ren  (** please contract Dr. Jeff Au Yeung if you are interest on this topic**)  Description:   With the advancement of mobile image sensors and smartphones, technologies of processing high resolution images and providing high quality  imaging experiences in an efficient manner are gaining increasingly more attention. Two core ideas of processing large image efficiently in real  systems (used by companies such as Google and Sony, etc.) are to adopt the divide-and-conquer strategy as well as leveraging machine  learning.  The divide-and-conquer strategy, when applied to machine learning-based image processing, involves breaking down a large and complex  image processing task into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. These sub-problems are then solved independently, often in parallel, and  their results are subsequently combined to obtain the final solution for the original large problem.  In this project, given essential materials and instructions on machine learning algorithms using divide-and-conquer strategy, you will be asked to  implement an image processing system using the knowledge you learn. The system will be applied in important applications of image  processing such as super-resolution and sensor demosaic. You will also be asked to evaluate the resulting image quality, training speed and  inference time. You also need to experiment the trade-offs between the model scale and image processing quality. Potential of such system in  real applications will also be discussed in the project.  Basic Requirement:  •   Familiar with Python  •   Willing to learn basic knowledge of machine learning, neural networks and PyTorch during the project  •   Comfortable of working with undergraduate level Calculus and linear algebra  •   Enthusiastic about image processing and interested in building practical image processing systems
